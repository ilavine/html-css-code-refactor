# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

The purpose of this week's challenge was **Code Refactoring**, i.e. improving existing code (improving it without changing what it does). For this particular Challenge, refactoring has been done on the existing code to make it more accessible. 

**The following issues have been addressed**:

* Refactiored anchor elements to ensure that navigation links work correctly.
* Added semnatic HTML elements to clearly define the content of the HTML file.
* HTML file now includes comments.
* CSS selectors and properties have been consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
* CSS code redundancy has been addressed.
* CSS file now includes comments.
* A new GitHub repository on your GitHub and cloned to the local machine. The `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands have been used to push the code to remote repository.
* The web page has been deployed via GitHub pages. 

**The URL of the deployed application:** https://ilavine.github.io/html-css-code-refactor/

**The URL of the GitHub repository:** https://github.com/ilavine/html-css-code-refactor

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The Horiseon webpage includes a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.](./assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png))

> **Note**: This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px.
